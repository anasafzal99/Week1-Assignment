      <p>
        The Sinner follows a young mother who, when overcome by an inexplicable
        fit of rage, commits a startling act of violence and to her horror has
        no idea why. The event launches an inverted and utterly surprising crime
        thriller whose driving force is not the "who" or the "what" -- but the
        "why" -- as an investigator finds himself obsessed with uncovering the
        woman's buried motive. Together they travel a harrowing journey into the
        depths of her psyche and the violent secrets hidden in her past.

      <h2>Breaking Bad</h2>
      <p>
        Walter H. White is a chemistry genius, but works as a chemistry teacher
        in an Albuquerque, New Mexico high school. His life drastically changes
        when he's diagnosed with stage III terminal lung cancer, and given a
        short amount of time left to live: a mere matter of months. To ensure
        his handicapped son and his pregnant wife have a financial future, Walt
        uses his chemistry background to create and sell the world's finest
        crystal methamphetamine. To sell his signature "blue meth," he teams up
        with Jesse Pinkman, a former student of his. The meth makes them very
        rich very quickly, but it attracts the attention of his DEA brother in
        law Hank. As Walt and Jesse's status in the drug world escalates, Walt
        becomes a dangerous criminal and Jesse becomes a hot-headed salesman.
        Hank is always hot on his tail, and it forces Walt to come up with new
        ways to cover his tracks.
